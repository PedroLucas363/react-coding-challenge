## RBR React Coding Challenge

This is a simple application, with simple CRUD operations, being able to list, add, remove and view messages.

For this challenge, you need to start with the given code, make all the refactorings and code changes you deem necessary to make the code functional, well structured, readable and following the most current development standards. Feel free to make any modifications you like and any bug fixes you find.

In addition, you should implement unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library and end-to-end tests using Cypress in this project. As it is an extremely small project, it is expected that the candidate will be able to do the full test coverage of the few components and functionalities that it has.

Candidates are also expected to be able to configure ESLint using the Airbnb standard and also configure commit standardization using Husky and Commitlint.

After completing the test, put it on Github, host it on vercel and share the repository and application link with the recruiters.
